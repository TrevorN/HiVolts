	Dude, Adam I hope you see this, because this is pretty important! We should rewrite HiVolts_Display to use a commandline-based output instead of one that opens a window and draws, because I just recently set up a laptop to run pure linux only that I will be brining to school for AP_COMPSCI and GRT, and as of now I haven't installed a desktop on it, so its only command line. E.G. I can work on hivolts, but I can't run it on this beauty of a machine! Not to mention it will be alot easer to write the drawing code...

-AP PARTAYYY!!!

Gentoo? Arch?
Ya, we can make it only command-line output, and simply change the display functions.
